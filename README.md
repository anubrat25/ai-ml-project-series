# Project Overview

This repository contains two chatbot projects:

1. Simple Chatbot
This chatbot can carry out simple conversational tasks. It extends greetings, sends farewell notes, and keeps track of past conversations. Despite its inability to comprehend user input, the chatbot is meant to be amiable and respond appropriately.

2. College Admission Chatbot
The purpose of this chatbot is to help people with questions about college entrance. It offers details on requirements, deadlines, and admissions processes based on a PDF file that is submitted. The chatbot allows users to ask several questions in a single session and engages them in a conversational flow. It also keeps track of past conversations for better communication.

## Features

- Remembers Previous Chats: In order to deliver more pertinent responses, the chatbot is able to recollect previous exchanges.
 - Kind Responses: To maintain an interesting dialogue, the chatbot will reply kindly when it cannot comprehend the user's input.
 - Greeting and departure: When a user ends a conversation, the chatbot extends a friendly greeting and wishes them a fond departure.

## Usage

You can engage with the chatbot once it has started operating. When you first engage in discussion, the chatbot will greet you and recall your previous exchanges. Your messages can be typed, and the chatbot will reply appropriately. In the event that it interprets your input incorrectly, it will reply amicably. When you say "goodbye," the chatbot will bid you farewell and stop the conversation.
